## üéØ Project Background
In PC web-based instant messaging scenarios, standardized message templates can greatly improve reply efficiency and maintain content consistency. However, templates are often scattered across documents, spreadsheets, or chat records, and sometimes rely on personal memory. As business needs evolve, the variety of templates increases, making them hard to find, difficult to manage, and prone to version inconsistencies.

Speech Repo was developed to address these issues: it centralizes frequently used replies, organizes them with categories and tags, and provides one-click copy functionality‚Äîso templates are always ready when needed, without hunting through files or relying on memory.
